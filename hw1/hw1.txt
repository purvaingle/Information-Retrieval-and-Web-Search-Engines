Based on the findings, there is an average overlap of 14.3% and an average Spearman coefficient of -3.536.
The low level of overlap between Google and DuckDuckGo results suggests limited similarity. Additionally, the negative Spearman coefficient indicates that the overlapping results are not related. This implies a significant disparity in how both search engines rank results in terms of relevance to the query.

If we are benchmarking DuckDuckGo against Google's performance, we can say that DuckDuckGo's performance falls short of Google's i.e. it performs worse than Google.
